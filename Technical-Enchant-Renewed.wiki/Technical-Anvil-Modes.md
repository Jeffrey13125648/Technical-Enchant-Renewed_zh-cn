# Merging Mode
This mode allow you to use the Technical Anvil as a normal Anvil, but for TE+ custom enchantments, meaning that you can do things such as combining books with books, item with books and even items with items of the same type!

If the combination is valid, it will create an item at the bottom middle part of the UI, you can hover over it to see the result. This is very useful in case you're combining enchantments such as Agility or Life+, that adds another attribute to the item; or to see the new Lore display that the item will have. 

You can't get this output until you confirm it by pressing the above item. If you pressed it, it won't do anything if you don't have more that 10 levels. I could be quite a lot, but you can combine enchantment after enchantment without dealing with Too Expensive, feature.

If you got the levels, the input items will get deleted and you will get the desided output item.

# Extracting Mode

This mode allows you to get custom enchantments from a custom enchanted item at no cost! Just keep in mind that you can't extract vanilla enchantments and custom curses. This mode also serves as a disenchant system in some way.

There are two slots, the left one is for enchanted items ONLY, and the right one is for normal vanilla books ONLY. If you placed them correctly, then you will have a display result in the middle, which is going to be a custom enchanted book.

To complete the action, just click on the item below the output, and you should see that one normal book will get consumed; the inout item will loose the extracted enchantment; and of course, you will get the extracted enchanted book.

Note that the enchantment that is going to be extracted, may not the the first or last one displayed in the item's Lore.
