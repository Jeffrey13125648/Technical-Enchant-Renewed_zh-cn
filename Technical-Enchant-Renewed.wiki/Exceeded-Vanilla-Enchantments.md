There is a new max level enchantment for 20 vanilla enchantments. You can increase the max limit using Admin Commands. Notice that if you put an exceeded enchantment, and then use the normal Anvil, this exceeded enchantment is going to disappear and you will have to add it again. 

Also, after running the uninstall command, items with these enchantments are still going to work, so as an operatior _consider enabling or disabling this extention from the begining._


By default the new level is for:

* Efficiency VI
* Feather Falling V
* Fire Aspect III
* Fortune IV
* Impaling VI
* Knockback III
* Looting IV
* Luck of the sea V
* Lure IV
* Piercing VI
* Power VI
* Protection V
* Punch III
* Respiration III
* Riptide IV
* Sharpness VII
* Sweeping edge V
* Swift Sneak IV
* Thorns V
* Unbreaking V
