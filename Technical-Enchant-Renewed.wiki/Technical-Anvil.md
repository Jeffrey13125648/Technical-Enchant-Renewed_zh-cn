This is one of the most important items in TE+. You can obtain it by throwing an UNDAMAGED anvil on an enchanting table while having 8 lapis blocks in your inventory.

Once you place it down, you will generate a new working station. You can remove it by aiming at the slab hitbox and just break it to get back the item form.

# Interaction

When you right click the top part, it will display a custom UI, that can be improved if you use the resource pack. If you press the top middle icon of the UI, you will switch between the Technical Anvil modes. Don't worry, if you had items before switching the mode, those items will get back to your inventory. You even get an advancement for doing this.

The technical anvil prevents players taking UI items as well for hoppers and hopper minecarts (don't even try).

Depending on the mode it is working, when completing the action (confirm the output), the Technical Anvil will display different particle effects and sounds.
