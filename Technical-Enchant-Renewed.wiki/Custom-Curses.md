You can oobtain them randomly through the enchanting table, chest loot or mob drops. If you're unlicky enough to get one, you need to know that custom curses can't be disenchanted in any form. Custom curses has a different color to diferentiate it from the rest.

# Curse of Exhaustion

This curse only applies to tools. It has a random chance to make you feel really tired for 5 seconds. During this state you won't be able to mine any blocks, move correctly or jump. It may have some side effects if you're in water or flying!

# Curse of Fear

This curse only applies to weapons. While holding this weapon you get scared if there are hostile mobs in a 25 block radious. The more mobs are the weaker you get (less attack damage, attack speed and movement speed). Stonger mobs will scare you more. In case you try to use a bow or crossbow, this curse will reduce the damage dealt by that arrow.

# Curse of Fragile

This curse can be applied to any item, and will them to take more durability. However, you can counter this curse with unbreaking enchantment.

# Curse of Sensitive

This curse only applies to armor (including elytra and shield). If you take damage, you have a small chance to explode; the explosion isn't that big, so most of the cases it won't kill you. However, this curse stack per armor piece, meaning that you can be very unlucky and trigger a big explosion at once.

When this curse is in a shield, the explosion triggers only when you block an incoming attack.

# Curse of Slippery

This curse only applies to any Tools and Weapons. Each time you use it, you have a tiny possibility to drop it. When this happens, a sound and a particle will let you know.
