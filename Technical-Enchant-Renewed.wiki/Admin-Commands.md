You have 4 different commands that you can use as an operator:

`/function enchantplus:give/all`

***

`/function enchantplus:config`

This command will allow you to change many features from the datapack. You can change general gameplay options, enable/disable enchantments and modify extentions if you don't like the default options

***

`/function #enchantplus:uninstall`

This command will uninstall the datapack safely from your world as well as its other dependencies such as complements and addons. Note that this command has some limitations with Agility, Anti-Knockback, Armored, Attack Speed, Hardness+, Life+ and exceeded vanilla enchantments. It is your responsability to with that "side" effect after uninstalling the datapack.

This command when run will select a random neares entity to transform it into an "enchanted mob". You will get different error messages if some conditions aren't met. If the conversion was successful, you will hear a sound telling you that a mob has been converted.
