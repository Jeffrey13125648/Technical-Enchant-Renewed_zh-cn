**Obtaining:** Just drop 1 normal bookshelf while having at least 8 lapis lazuli in your inverntory.

**Description:** This is the most important item to start enchanting with this datapack. Once you place it down, it will display a cool particle animation. However, this animation changes if the datapack is set to "low performance mode".

**Usage:** Charged bookshelves are used to increase the "enchanting setup" of your enchanting table. You just need to place the carged bookshelves around the enchanting table as you do it in vanilla.
