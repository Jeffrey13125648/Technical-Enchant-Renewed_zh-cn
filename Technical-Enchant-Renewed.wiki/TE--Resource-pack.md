If you add TE+ official resource pack, the Guide Book will get a unique texture and the Technical Anvil UI will be much cleaner for merging and extracting mode. 

Most importantly, all the infomration (guide book, commands, etc...) will get translated if the language is supported. Currently TE+ supports:

* Japanese
* Spanish
* Portuguese
* Chinese
* Thai

If you wan't your language to be supported considering sending me a message through discord and I'll check it. You can go to assets/teplus/lang/template and use that file to start translating it to your language (there is a lot of information though).

You can download the resource pack [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/twduc0miegsygcv/teplus_repack_7-2-3.zip?dl=1)
