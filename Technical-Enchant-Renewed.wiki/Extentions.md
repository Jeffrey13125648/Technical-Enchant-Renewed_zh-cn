These are several features from the datapack that you can toggle on/off and change their behaviour using Admin commands. Extentions try to add interesting features to your gameplay when using TE+.

# Mob use

Most hostile mobs will be able to use custom enchanted gear. Inluding armor, weapons and some tools enchantments. However, their use may be a bit different due to "obvious" limitations. Keep in mind that there are some cases that only an specific type of mob can use an specific enchantment; like the skeleton, that is able to use custom bow enchantments, but not crossbow enchantments.

# Mob spawn

Now, every few often, some hostile mobs will spawn with custom enchanted gear. This gear can be from any material excluding netherite. These mobs can spawn with different gear, each one with one or more custom enchantments. So you can get very lucky and encounter a fully enchanted mob!

Important to mention that the drop chances for the mob to drop their gear is very low, but you can change it for each gear piece using Admin Commands.

# Mob drops

Every 3 minutes, almost any mob that isn't the player, a villager, a boss or a pet, can get converted into an "enchanted mob".

This mob will have some custom particle to diferentiate it from the rest, and it can even glow with a color according to it's rarity (this glow option is disabled by default!). 

* Green is for low enchantments
* Aqua is for average enchantments
* Red is for strong enchantments
* Pink is for custom curses

This mob has a chance to drop a custom enchanted book when killed with at least a looting III enchantment.

# Chest loot

Every vanilla structure has a 30% chance to generate loot with a custom enchanted book. This book can also have a 10% chance to be a custom curse. 

You need to know that this extention uses a different system, because it doesn't overwrite vanilla chests loot-table, so it should be compatible with other datapacks or mods that tweak the vanilla loot-table. 

However is very IMPORTANT to open the chest first and generate the loot, rather than just breaking the loot-chest before opening it. Otherwise you won't get a custom enchanted book, no matter you do!

# Exceed Vanilla enchantments

You can increase the level of certain vanilla enchantments using the Technical Anvil. You first need to create an "exceeded book". For example lets say you have 2 efficiency V books, you now need to put them in the Technical Anvil and you will get efficiency VI in the output slot.

Now you can continue doing the same process again until you hit the new level limit. You can now apply that exceeded book into items that support that enchantment. Notice that vanilla incompatibilities are still going to be present.

You can find the list of exceeded enchantments [here](https://github.com/Frektip/Technical-Enchant-Renewed/wiki/Exceeded-Vanilla-Enchantments)
