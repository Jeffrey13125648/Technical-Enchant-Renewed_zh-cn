Just drop your custom enchanted item on top of a grindstone, and all of your custom enchantments and vanilla enchantments will get removed. Also, you will get a fair amount of xp in relation with all the enchantments your item had and at what level they were.

Another thing to mention is that if your item had a custom Lore, when disenchanting it, it will get the custom enchantments Lore removed, but the other custom Lore will get preserved.

**IMPORTANT!!!** if your item had custom or vanilla curses, those ones won't get removed.
